        This tutorial assumes you are proficient with command line, have git installed, and are familiar with version control. We'll walk through some basic commands to get comfortable with git.

    <div class="text">
        We'll use a <g>test/</g> directory that contains two empty files: <g>one.txt</g> and <g>two.txt</g>.

        <b>git init</b>

        <b>git status</b>
        shows you the files that are staged for a commit.

    <div class="text">
        Run git status and you'll see<br>

<pre>On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
(use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

one.txt
two.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
</pre>

        We'll use git status frequently to examine our staging area.

<pre>On branch master

Initial commit

Changes to be committed:

new file:   one.txt
new file:   two.txt

    <hr>
    <div class="text">
        If you want to unstage a file, use <b>git rm --cached (file name)</b>. <br>

        creates a commit from staged files. Each commit has a unique hash based on your message, name, email, and commit time.<br><br>

        If you removed your files from staging, add them to staging again. <br>

        Run git commit -m 'add one.txt and two.txt' and you'll see <br>

        <b>git checkout </b>
        reverts your files back to what they looked a commit. Use <b>git checkout (commit hash) </b> for a single commit and <b>git checkout master </b> to go to the latest version.

    <div class="text">
        Run git checkout 06380f and you'll see

<pre>
Note: checking out '06390f'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

HEAD is now at 06390f1... add text to one.txt
</pre>

    You have reverted your files to their states at the first commit. Look around and you'll see that the files are empty.
    </div>

    <div class="text">
        To go back to the latest version, run git checkout master and you'll see
<pre>
Switched to branch 'master'
</pre>

    Look around again and you'll see that one.txt has the latest text.
